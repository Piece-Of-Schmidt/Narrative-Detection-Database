# Narrative Detection using LLMs


[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/997336410.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15622517)


This repository contains evaluation data accompanying the paper  
**"Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora ‚Äì An integrated approach using Large Language Models"**  
(*Ruhr Economics Paper*, 2025).

The project explores how Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, can be used to extract economic narratives from newspaper articles. We focus on inflation-related narratives found in articles from *The Wall Street Journal* and *The New York Times*. The extracted narratives are compared to a carefully annotated gold standard created by three expert coders.
